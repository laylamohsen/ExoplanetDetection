PROBLEM STATEMENT
-----------------\\

The quest to discover new habitable planets has been a 
driving force in astronomical research due to the risk of 
Earth's depleting lifetime and the ambition of space 
exploration. Traditional methods of exoplanet detection, 
such as the radial velocity and transit mathematical 
methods, have proven effective but are often constrained by 
their reliance on complex algorithms and human 
interpretation. These methods require meticulous analysis 
of a large amount of astronomical data, which can be 
tedious for every exoplanet detection.\\

The deployment of machine learning techniques have 
proven to be of great importance in the detection and 
classification of exoplanets. Machine learning, offers a 
transformative approach to exoplanet detection by 
leveraging algorithms capable of learning intricate patterns 
within data with high speed as well as accuracy. By 
training on large datasets of known exoplanets, machine 
learning models can learn to recognize subtle signatures 
indicative of exoplanetary transits, orbital dynamics, and 
other telltale signals, which can produce promising results
